In search of recompense, The Dude tracks down his namesake, who offers him a job. His wife has been kidnapped and he needs a reliable bagman. Aided and hindered by his pals Walter Sobchak, a Vietnam vet, and Donny, master of stupidity.</a>
              <br><br>
              In The Big Lebowski, The Dude is sent on a mission and winds up at pornographer Jackie Treehorn’s house. The Sheats Goldstein Residence was designed by architect John Lautner in 1963, which is situated in the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles. “’There are almost no 90-degree angles in the house. John was very much opposed to a box-like approach to design,’ explains owner James Goldstein, the septuagenarian businessman who just donated the house and its contents to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. With a purchase price of $185,000 in 1972, the current bottom line comes to north of $40m, including the site-specific skyspace installation by light-and-space sculptor James Turrell, as well as artwork by the likes of Ed Ruscha and Kenny Scharf.”
              <br><br>
              The building was designed from the inside out and built into the ledge of the hillside. The house is an example of “American Organic Architecture that derives its form as an extension of the natural environment and of the individual for whom it was built”. This idea of American Organic Architecture was seen in Ray and Charles Eames designs where they used natural materials such as plywood and molded them in ways to compliment the natural shape and purpose of the original material. The furniture in the house, extremely evident in the couches (where The Dude is sitting on below), is custom-designed to fit the angles of the home, every detail being thought about.
